# Overview
This project was created mainly as a way of seeing if Technical analysis is BS or not.

The jury is still out.

The book I started with was in python, as is most intro to TA materials.
Makes sense given the quick implementations that can be done.
Unfortunately, stringing together into a coherent reusable project was un-wieldly so I decided to reimplement in kotlin.
When this eventually goes into ML and Agentic AI, the python side may be used again.
